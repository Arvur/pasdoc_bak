This is converted to Lazarus version of VCL/CLX program
HelpGenerator by Richard B. Winston.
I (Michalis) converted it to Lazarus (LCL). This is a portable code,
it should compile and work everywhere where FPC, FCL, LCL are ported.

It depends on pasdoc_package for Lazarus in pasdoc sources,
so be sure to install pasdoc_package in Lazarus before opening
pasdoc_gui project.

I'm also putting this source code under GNU GPL (original version
was on public domain). This should effectively solve any legal concerns
with HelpGenerator that I mentioned on pasdoc-main list:
now we have
- GNU GPLed program that uses
- GNU GPLed pasdoc and
- LCL (released on modified GNU LGPL).
So everything if free, legal, binaries of this program may be
distributed without problems etc.

Of course solving the legal concerns was not the main goal,
the main goals are:

- demonstrate using pasdoc components in Lazarus

- provide alternative way to use pasdoc for people that
  don't want to learn pasdoc's command-line and don't need
  to call pasdoc in "batch" mode.

  This was also intention of original HelpGenerator, but now
  we got it absolutely free, without any dependency on Delphi/Kylix,
  and portable everywhere where FPC is.

  TODO: Although it should be easy to modify this program
  to let it be called in batch mode. This would allow users
  to create their configuration using GUI, then call this program
  (or some other) giving name of the file with settings as
  parameter. This would allow users to still use pasdoc functionality
  in batch mode, and at the same time not learn pasdoc's command-line.

See HISTORY file for changes that I did while converting HelpGenerator
to FPC/Lazarus pasdoc_gui.

Development things:

- In case of uncertainties, we should try to conform to GNOME HIG 2.0
  standards. This is (at least for now) not to be taken *too* strictly,
  so don't worry if you don't know GNOME HIG.

- pasdoc_gui.lpi XML file contains many important project settings,
  but also many settings that you can easily modify "by accident".
  (actually, this is the same problem as with Delphi/Kylix config files)

  We just have to live with it. So:
  when committing don't worry if you accidentaly modified something
  in pasdoc_gui.lpi file, but try to not commit anything really
  "breaking" there, that could make difficult for other developers
  to open a project.
