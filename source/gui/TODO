- We should store filenames like Lazarus files:
  - property in ini file for FilePathDelim
  - when reading we 1st read FilePathDelim,
    then in all filenames we replace FilePathDelim with current PathDelim.
  - when writing we set FilePathDelim to current PathDelim

  Add then to [http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/PasDocGui] text like

Moreover, as long as you will keep ''Store relative paths in project file'' option checked, you can freely open and save the same *.pds file using any OS. E.g. you can create and save {{{test.pds}}} using Linux version of pasdoc_gui, then switch to Windows and open the same {{{test.pds}}} file using Windows version of pasdoc_gui, etc.

- GraphViz improvements:
  - There must be a way to specify file extension
    (e.g. there *must* be a way to differ between svg and png formats;
    not to mention that there *should* be a way to differ between various
    pixel-based image formats).

  - Also for command-line pasdoc:
    By default dot should be automatically run by pasdoc component,
    although there should be a way to turn it off.
    It would be also nice to have a way to let pasdoc component
    automatically call dot but at the same time change some
    dot's command-line options (e.g. force "-Grankdir=LR").

    Last possibility could be used by pasdoc_gui to provide
    some GUI controls that affect generated command-line
    options passed to dot. E.g. pasdoc_gui could provide
    TRadioBox to control "-Grankdir=LR|RL|BT" option for dot.

  - Also for command-line pasdoc:
    See also requests about using client-side image map generated
    by "dot", see [http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/WantedFeatures].

- When we will learn how to generate nice offline documentation
  from our moinmoin wiki and we will distribute pasdoc + pasdoc_gui +
  offline docs in one package, this will fire up WWW browser
  with a local HTML page (still, configuration option will
  be added to allow users who are always online to see the latest
  version of documentation from WWW, instead of looking at offline
  version).

- pasdoc_gui should allow user to configure default state of "Defines".
  Actually, it should allow user to configure default state of *all* options.
  E.g. maybe someone always wants to make default language of docs = Polish ?
  Maybe someone wants default verbosity = 6 ?
  Maybe someone has some include directory with his include files that
  he wants to always be added to "Include dirs" by default ?
  This can all be very nicely solved by storing some "default project settings"
  in user's directory and loading it on program start (and menu "New" execution).
  Then the code that currently loads contents from Ini file can be modified
  to actually have really good default values, and instead of using "SetDefaults"
  we simply load from a file where "default project settings" for this user
  are stored (like ~/.pasdoc_gui/default.pds on Unixes)

- ButtonAspellURL and ButtonGraphVizURL and ButtonPasdocURL should be changed to
  have blue and underlined font and cursor crHand.
  Maybe also turn them into labels.
  This seems not possible now (with Lazarus 0.9.10 on GTK interface),
  for now normal buttons look best.
