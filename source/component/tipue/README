This directory contains some files from tipue,
version 1.1.1 from http://www.tipue.com/,
slightly modified.

Our modifications and reasoning are marked in source with "PasDoc" comment.
Our results page is named "_tipue_results.html" (new tipue version
doesn't suggest any particular name for this; we pick a name to not collide with
user unit name).

These files are processed by programs file_to_pascal_string and
file_to_pascal_data (in ../../tools/)
and then their contents are included in PasDoc_Tipue unit.
So all needed tipue data is compiled inside pasdoc binary.
This way you don't have to download and unpack tipue to use it with pasdoc.
As pasdoc is now able to automatically generate tipue index data,
users do not have to do (or even know) *anything* about tipue at all
to use it with pasdoc. It's just a matter of passing --use-tipue-search.
(we can't use tipue by default, without explicit request by --use-tipue-search
option, since it's not suitable for really large documentation,
see [http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/UseTipueSearchOption]).

Future notes about possible data layout (possibly outdated rambling,
Michalis wrote it when implementing first tipue version :)

    With my first try at integrating tipue with pasdoc, I made an option
    --use-tipue-search=/path/where/tipue/was/unpacked/ and then in pasdoc
    I was copying scripts from tipue (with some processing in the middle).
    But it turned out that there are a few modifications to tipue files
    that I would like to do, so, since tipue scripts are very small,
    I realized that just including "fixed" tipue version compiled inside
    pasdoc may be better solution.

    In the future the best option would be to make some installers/packages
    for pasdoc and put tipue files for pasdoc in some directory that pasdoc
    knows about. This would remove the necessity to keep everything in one
    binary file, as we could handle nicely the fact that pasdoc always
    installs some additional external files for itself.
    For now, embedding these files in pasdoc binary seems the simplest option
    for users.
