Integration with Tipue (http://www.tipue.com/search/ ), version 3.0.1.

Some of the files here are copied from Tipue sources (it's Ok to copy,
MIT license). The tipuesearch.css needed some tiny modifications (see
"PasDoc" comments inside).

Our results page is called "_tipue_results.html" (we picked a name
to avoid collisions with user unit name).

These files are processed by programs file_to_pascal_string and
file_to_pascal_data (in ../../tools/)
and then their contents are included in PasDoc_Tipue unit.
So all the needed tipue data is compiled inside pasdoc binary.
This way you don't have to download and unpack tipue to use it with pasdoc
--- Tipue data is inside PasDoc sources, and compiled inside PasDoc binary.
As pasdoc can automatically generate tipue index data,
users do not have to do (or even know) *anything* about tipue
to use it with pasdoc. It's just a matter of passing --use-tipue-search.
(we can't use tipue by default, without explicit request by --use-tipue-search
option, since it's not suitable for really large documentation,
see [http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/UseTipueSearchOption]).
