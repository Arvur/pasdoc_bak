In this directory you should be able to find packages that allow you
to install PasDoc components in Lazarus and Delphi IDE.

For Delphi package files may be specific to platform (Linux or Windows)
and Delphi version. Note that Kylix packages are in delphi/linux/
subdirectory, there is no kylix/ subdirectory.

For Lazarus we will provide packages just for latest version of Lazarus.
There should be no reason to provide separate packages for different
Lazarus versions, after all Lazarus is free and you can always upgrade it.
(Although in this README file may be some remarks how to install this package
in older versions of Lazarus.)
Great advantage of Lazarus packages is that they are not tied to
a particular platform, so there is no need to maintain different
package files for different platforms.

Note for Lazarus 0.9.6 beta and older:
  You must select the "Use Ansi Strings (-Sh)" compiler option
  (under "Parsing"). This will not be automatically selected because
  Lazarus 0.9.7 stores this setting in <SyntaxOptions> XML element
  in pasdoc_package.lpk, while 0.9.6 reads <SymantecChecking> element.

Package name is "pasdoc_package", not just "pasdoc", to avoid
any name conflicts with unit PasDoc.pas and the pasdoc program.
Version of the package reflects version stored in PASDOC_VERSION
constant in PasDoc unit.
